--You can use in-text "#name", it will replace it with the player's name, and in-text "#class" for the player's class.
--Dialogues are flexible. They can be: 
	--Strings: This will simply display the message as though the NCP is delivering it
	--Tables: Work the same as strings but will cycle through each message, giving user the ability to respond at the end of the conversation.
	--Functions: These can do... anything you like really. Usually used for talking with NPC's and simultaneously updating info (such as quests). Functions can return
		--Strings and tables, which work the same way as they do for typical dialogues, or nil, which will break out of the conversation immediately.

--Global dialogue is the core of most NPC's logic in conversation. This gives the most basic of functions, and therefore
--I recommend not playing with it too much. Information the entire world knows or specific functioanlity you want to add to
--convesations can be added here but I don't recommend messing with it too much.
