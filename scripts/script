--Note: throughout the script several "print" statements have been scattered to demonstrate progress. 
--These are nonessential, but useful for error detection.

--A simple single town, with a single quest giver and two storefronts, as well as one random NPC.
--This demonstrates the primary features of writing a town script, and a simple dungeon with quest queues.
