--[[An enchantment can either encompass a specific enchantment, one that can be applied to an item, or
	represent a class of enchantments that may apply to a number of different items. For example, being a
	rough item is an enchantment that hurts durability of cloth items, but #fabric is a class that encomasses
	any number enchantments that can apply to fabric items- roughness being one of them
	
	When items are generated there is a probablity (or it can be forced) that a random enchantment is applied
	to them, and the use of class tags allows the scripter to specify which enchantments are allowed.
	
	Nesting classes of enchantments is okay as well- an iron weapon is still made of metal, so exclusive iron
	enchantments like being cast or wrought iron apply as well as metal ones like purity and blistering.
